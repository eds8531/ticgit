Serious, Hard Working Students \\nFail to Build Huge Vocab Required to Score \\n\\nHigh in GRE? \\n\\nHere it is: Becoming Familiar with New Uncommon and Unusual \\n\\nGRE Words is Easy, But Still Remembering Them After a Few \\n\\nWeeks is Extremely Difficult \\n\\nThe biggest problem is that though it is relatively easy to learn new words at home or \\nin coaching classes, it is very very difficult to memorize the words and remember \\nafter a few weeks/months. \\n\\nEven the best coaching classes fail to put 4,000 to 4,500 words in the long-term \\nmemory of your mind because they do not specialize in mind power and mind \\ntechnologies. The best they can do, no matter how hard they work, is to prepare a \\ngood book offering you word lists and then motivate you to repeatedly read the word \\nlists in different ways many many times over several months and hope that you \\nremember many of the words.  \\n\\nBut, you cannot blame the coaching institutes because it is not their fault. It is the \\nnature of our mind, which is simply not capable of remembering many uncommon \\nand odd words just by reading word lists a few times and you know there is not a lot \\nof time to revise many many many times. \\n\\nIf you are concerned or worried about memorizing vocab, you are not alone--almost \\nevery student faces the same problem. Despite my hard work for over a year, I myself \\ngot only 20% in Verbal, though I got 97% in Q uantitative in GRE (see my GRE \\nscore card below), so I know how one can feel. \\n\\n \\n\\nMy wife, Dr Anju Bapna, who is a medical doctor, took GMAT exam in USA for \\nadmission to MBA. To get a good score, she took classroom coaching in California \\nfrom Kaplan, which is world\\'s number one coaching institute for GMAT training. The \\nfee was about $1,200. The Kaplan coaching proved ineffective and it totally failed to \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCassette 9 Side B-51 \\n\\nhelp her improve vocab for the GMAT exam. She was just lucky to get admission to \\nMBA she wanted. In fact, this coaching experience of her was what motivated me to \\ndevelop the Vocab-Builder Mind Machine on our return to India. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVocab-Builder Mind Machine is Becoming More and More Popular \\nAmong GRE, SAT, CAT, GMAT Aspirants Because Good Coaching \\n\\nAlone is Not Enough for Vocab\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\n \\n\\nAs you already know, Indian students tend to score high in Maths but low in English \\npart. The main reason for low score in Verbal is not knowing the vocab well which \\nmakes it much harder to answer questions correctly. Most of us in India are not so \\ngood in English vocab even if we have studied in English schools. \\n\\nGRE is also like a competition, where you get percentile (meaning you are better than \\nso many of the students). So, you need to find various ways, both small and big, if \\npossible unique and not-yet-common ways, to gain \"unfair advantage\" and get ahead \\nof others and win the race.  \\n\\nA competition is like a race where only certain number of students get success and \\nremaining fail. Mind Machine is kind of like being on an airplane when others in the \\nrace are on bikes, cars or cycles. Guess who will win such an unfair race?  \\n\\nThe mind machine provides one way to gain such \"unfair advantage\" because it puts \\nwords into your mind effortlessly. You perhaps realize that toppers are not two times \\nas intelligent as others and that toppers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t study two times as many hours as others \\nper day, but knowingly or unknowingly they use more mind power. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUsing mind \\npower\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the missing link in our education system and that makes the difference \\nbetween success and failure.  \\n\\n\"Vocab-Builder Mind Machine: \\n\\nNew Way to Memorize Vocab for GRE\" \\n\\n \\nVocab-Builder Mind Machine (GRE) \\n\\nIt consists of Mind Machine Player, ten pencil cells, 30 vocab cassettes with 5,871 \\n\\nwords and vocabulary books in 3 beautiful spiral-bound volumes.   \\n\\nNow, the new Vocab-Builder Mind Machine makes it possible to memorize vocab: \\nAll you have to do is close your eyes, relax, and listen to Mind Machine Cassettes on \\nMind Machine Player, and you memorize 3 to 7 times faster. In addition to \\n\\n\\x0cmemorizing words quickly, you also become better in English usage, pronunciation, \\nand fluency, which builds self-confidence.  \\n\\nCassette 9 Side B-52 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nB.E.

Serious, Hard Working Students \\nFail to Build Huge Vocab Required to Score \\n\\nHigh in GRE? \\n\\nHere it is: Becoming Familiar with New Uncommon and Unusual \\n\\nGRE Words is Easy, But Still Remembering Them After a Few \\n\\nWeeks is Extremely Difficult \\n\\nThe biggest problem is that though it is relatively easy to learn new words at home or \\nin coaching classes, it is very very difficult to memorize the words and remember \\nafter a few weeks/months. \\n\\nEven the best coaching classes fail to put 4,000 to 4,500 words in the long-term \\nmemory of your mind because they do not specialize in mind power and mind \\ntechnologies. The best they can do, no matter how hard they work, is to prepare a \\ngood book offering you word lists and then motivate you to repeatedly read the word \\nlists in different ways many many times over several months and hope that you \\nremember many of the words.  \\n\\nBut, you cannot blame the coaching institutes because it is not their fault. It is the \\nnature of our mind, which is simply not capable of remembering many uncommon \\nand odd words just by reading word lists a few times and you know there is not a lot \\nof time to revise many many many times. \\n\\nIf you are concerned or worried about memorizing vocab, you are not alone--almost \\nevery student faces the same problem. Despite my hard work for over a year, I myself \\ngot only 20% in Verbal, though I got 97% in Q uantitative in GRE (see my GRE \\nscore card below), so I know how one can feel. \\n\\n \\n\\nMy wife, Dr Anju Bapna, who is a medical doctor, took GMAT exam in USA for \\nadmission to MBA. To get a good score, she took classroom coaching in California \\nfrom Kaplan, which is world\\'s number one coaching institute for GMAT training. The \\nfee was about $1,200. The Kaplan coaching proved ineffective and it totally failed to \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCassette 9 Side B-51 \\n\\nhelp her improve vocab for the GMAT exam. She was just lucky to get admission to \\nMBA she wanted. In fact, this coaching experience of her was what motivated me to \\ndevelop the Vocab-Builder Mind Machine on our return to India. \\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVocab-Builder Mind Machine is Becoming More and More Popular \\nAmong GRE, SAT, CAT, GMAT Aspirants Because Good Coaching \\n\\nAlone is Not Enough for Vocab\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\n \\n\\nAs you already know, Indian students tend to score high in Maths but low in English \\npart. The main reason for low score in Verbal is not knowing the vocab well which \\nmakes it much harder to answer questions correctly. Most of us in India are not so \\ngood in English vocab even if we have studied in English schools. \\n\\nGRE is also like a competition, where you get percentile (meaning you are better than \\nso many of the students). So, you need to find various ways, both small and big, if \\npossible unique and not-yet-common ways, to gain \"unfair advantage\" and get ahead \\nof others and win the race.  \\n\\nA competition is like a race where only certain number of students get success and \\nremaining fail. Mind Machine is kind of like being on an airplane when others in the \\nrace are on bikes, cars or cycles. Guess who will win such an unfair race?  \\n\\nThe mind machine provides one way to gain such \"unfair advantage\" because it puts \\nwords into your mind effortlessly. You perhaps realize that toppers are not two times \\nas intelligent as others and that toppers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t study two times as many hours as others \\nper day, but knowingly or unknowingly they use more mind power. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUsing mind \\npower\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the missing link in our education system and that makes the difference \\nbetween success and failure.  \\n\\n\"Vocab-Builder Mind Machine: \\n\\nNew Way to Memorize Vocab for GRE\" \\n\\n \\nVocab-Builder Mind Machine (GRE) \\n\\nIt consists of Mind Machine Player, ten pencil cells, 30 vocab cassettes with 5,871 \\n\\nwords and vocabulary books in 3 beautiful spiral-bound volumes.   \\n\\nNow, the new Vocab-Builder Mind Machine makes it possible to memorize vocab: \\nAll you have to do is close your eyes, relax, and listen to Mind Machine Cassettes on \\nMind Machine Player, and you memorize 3 to 7 times faster. In addition to \\n\\n\\x0cmemorizing words quickly, you also become better in English usage, pronunciation, \\nand fluency, which builds self-confidence.  \\n\\nCassette 9 Side B-52 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nB.E.
