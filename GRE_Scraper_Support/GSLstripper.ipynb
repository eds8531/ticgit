With <em>so</em> many words that might appear on your individual iteration of the GRE, it can be hard to fathom learning them all. Full vocabulary lists span thousands of words, with no guarantee that the terms you learn will be the ones you see on test day.<p>We have written previously on the benefits of game-ifying and strategizing effectively around GRE vocabulary. To that end, we’ve delineated a selection of common vocabulary into three levels of difficulty, so that you ascend in difficulty the more words you learn. If you want to expand your selection, try following <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/economistgretutor/\" target=\"blank\">Economist GRE Tutor on Instagram</a> or downloading our <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gre-daily-vocabulary/id1146529237?mt=8\" target=\"blank\">GRE Daily Vocabulary app</a>, for a new word every day. <h2>Level One GRE Vocabulary: Least Difficult</h2><p><a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/aberration/2016-09-26\">Aberration</a>: noun, a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected<br/>“The Fed will probably need convincing that the latest labour-market report was an <a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/aberration/2016-09-26\">aberration</a>before tightening policy.”<br/><em>Source: \"When barometers go wrong\" published in The Economist</em><p><a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abreast/2017-02-09\">Abreast</a>: adjective, Up to date with the latest news, ideas, or information<br/>Synonyms: in touch with, plugged into<br/>“These daily updates were designed to help readers keep <a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abreast/2017-02-09\">abreast</a> of the markets...”<br/><em>Source: \"China’s market mess\" published in The Economist</em><p><a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abstain/2017-02-18\">Abstain</a>: verb, Restrain oneself from doing or enjoying something<br/>Synonyms: refrain, desist, hold back<br/>“The decision to <a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abstain/2017-02-18\">abstain</a> from such techniques, just and wise though it was, came at a cost.”<br/><em>Source: \"Standard operating procedure\" published in The Economist</em><p>Abyss: noun, a deep or seemingly bottomless chasm<br/>Synonyms: gorge, ravine, void<br/>“Whose dire warnings about risks... seem most believable?

With <em>so</em> many words that might appear on your individual iteration of the GRE, it can be hard to fathom learning them all. Full vocabulary lists span thousands of words, with no guarantee that the terms you learn will be the ones you see on test day.<p>We have written previously on the benefits of game-ifying and strategizing effectively around GRE vocabulary. To that end, we’ve delineated a selection of common vocabulary into three levels of difficulty, so that you ascend in difficulty the more words you learn. If you want to expand your selection, try following <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/economistgretutor/\" target=\"blank\">Economist GRE Tutor on Instagram</a> or downloading our <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gre-daily-vocabulary/id1146529237?mt=8\" target=\"blank\">GRE Daily Vocabulary app</a>, for a new word every day. <h2>Level One GRE Vocabulary: Least Difficult</h2><p><a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/aberration/2016-09-26\">Aberration</a>: noun, a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected<br/>“The Fed will probably need convincing that the latest labour-market report was an <a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/aberration/2016-09-26\">aberration</a>before tightening policy.”<br/><em>Source: \"When barometers go wrong\" published in The Economist</em><p><a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abreast/2017-02-09\">Abreast</a>: adjective, Up to date with the latest news, ideas, or information<br/>Synonyms: in touch with, plugged into<br/>“These daily updates were designed to help readers keep <a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abreast/2017-02-09\">abreast</a> of the markets...”<br/><em>Source: \"China’s market mess\" published in The Economist</em><p><a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abstain/2017-02-18\">Abstain</a>: verb, Restrain oneself from doing or enjoying something<br/>Synonyms: refrain, desist, hold back<br/>“The decision to <a href=\"https://gre.economist.com/gre-vocabulary/abstain/2017-02-18\">abstain</a> from such techniques, just and wise though it was, came at a cost.”<br/><em>Source: \"Standard operating procedure\" published in The Economist</em><p>Abyss: noun, a deep or seemingly bottomless chasm<br/>Synonyms: gorge, ravine, void<br/>“Whose dire warnings about risks... seem most believable?
